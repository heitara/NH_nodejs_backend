# Homework 

This is your last home work that you should analyse and implement on your computer.

## Tasks

#### **1\. Diagnostics: Analyzing Errors**

**Task**: Analyze and fix an error in a Node.js application located in `sample/task1.js`.

**Exercise**:

1.  Run the code and observe the error.
2.  Modify the code to handle the error instead of crashing the application.
3.  Log a meaningful error message to the console.

#### **2\. Debugging**

**Task**: Debug a logical error in the application located in `sample/task2.js`.

**Exercise**:

1.  Identify the bug using `console.log` or the Node.js `debugger` statement.
2.  Fix the bug so the function calculates the correct sum.
3.  Test the function with an empty array and handle the edge case properly.
4.  Extract the function in a separate module using CommonJS. 
5.  Write a test case that tests the function correctness with 3 or more tests.

#### **3\. Node.js Debugger**

**Task**: Debug the program using the Node.js debugger tool located in `sample/task3.js`.

**Exercise**:

1.  Run the program with `node inspect <filename>`.
2.  Set breakpoints to step through the `findLargestNumber` function.
3.  Observe how variables change at each iteration of the loop and fix the error.

> Tip: Write some tests to check that the function is working as expected. Use different inputs.

#### **4\. Performance Analysis**

**Task**: Measure the performance of a function located in `sample/task4.js`.

**Exercise**:

1.  Use the `console.time()` and `console.timeEnd()` methods to measure the execution time of `slowFunction`.
2.  Optimize the function to improve its performance.
3.  Compare the execution time of the original and optimized versions.

#### **5\. Analyzing Stack Traces**

**Task**: Debug and fix a function with a recursive call located in `sample/task5.js`.

**Exercise**:

1.  Run the code and observe the stack trace of the error.
2.  Refactor the function to use an iterative approach to avoid a stack overflow.


## Bonus tasks

#### 5 Bonus Recursion-Based Tasks

1. Sum of Array Elements

    Write a recursive function that computes the sum of all numbers in an array.

```javascript
    function sumArray(arr) {
        // Your code here
    }

    console.log(sumArray([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])); // Output: 15
```
2. Find the Maximum Number in an Array

    Write a recursive function that finds the largest number in an array.
```javascript
    function findMax(arr) {
        // Your code here
    }

    console.log(findMax([3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9])); // Output: 9
```
3. Reverse a string

    Write a recursive function that reverses a given string.
```javascript
    function reverseString(str) {
        // Your code here
    }

    console.log(reverseString("hello")); // Output: "olleh"
```
4. Calculate Factorial
    
    Write a recursive function that calculates the factorial of a number.
```javascript
    function factorial(n) {
        // Your code here
    }

    console.log(factorial(5)); // Output: 120
```
5. Count Occurrences of a Character in a String

    Write a recursive function that counts how many times a given character appears in a string.
```javascript
    function countChar(str, char) {
        // Your code here
    }

    console.log(countChar("recursion is fun", "r")); // Output: 2
```
