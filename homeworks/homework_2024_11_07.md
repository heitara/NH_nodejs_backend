# Homework 

This is your second home work that you should implement on your computer.

## Tasks

Read a large file using `fs.createReadStream()`.

> You can download a large file from [here]().

> Use the `data` and `end` events.

Try to count the size in bytes of the file. Check if the size returned by
[`fs.lstat()`](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest-v20.x/api/fs.html#fslstatpath-options-callback) is identical.

Create a new buffer with size 256 bytes.

Write a text in that buffer. For example: `I'm learning NodeJS and node:fs module.`.

Try to modify the text in the buffer by using [indexing](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest-v20.x/api/buffer.html#bufindex).

Create a promise which resolves at random after 2 seconds. If the number is even it's resolved if the number is odd it's rejected.

```javascript
function getRandomInt(max) {
  return Math.floor(Math.random() * max);
}
```

Handle the results of the promise. Use `then` and `catch`.

Create another promise that returns `100` after 1 second.

Try to collect the results of both promises if they execute one after another and print the result.

> For example if the result of the first promise is `2`, the final result should be `[2, 100]`.
> To achive promise chaining, you have to `return` a promise in the `then`.

Use `async/await` to implement the first promise (even vs odd).

Try to call it using `try/catch`.

Log the error on the screen.
