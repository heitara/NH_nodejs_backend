# Homework 

This is your fourth home work that you should implement on your computer.

## Tasks

1. Create a basic express app (a NodeJS server using express module). Then register a GET endpoint `/files` that lists (in plain JSON array) all the files and folders in the current working directory of the "server".
2. Create a basic script that fetches the `/files` endpoint.
3. Configure your express server (from point 1) to serve static files stored in `public` sub-folder.
> How to test? Copy an image in the public subfolder. For example `image.png`. Try to access your static asset using the following url `http://localhost:3000/image.png` from the browser. You should see the image.
4. Register a POST endpoint that can be used to upload a file. The upload files are saved in `./uploads` sub-folder in the project.  * (hard one)
> Tips: Look for an external module that can be used to intercept files (middleware).
5. Create a script that uploads a file to your server.

6. Create a brand new porject using `npx express-generator`.
> Use this project for some hints on how to structure your project and how to use express.
7. Create a test that covers the scripts developed in point 2 and point 5.
8. Implement the following hierarchy of JS classes/types:

Car     -> RacingCar -> ElectricRC 
+ color()

9. Create a function that demos it.
